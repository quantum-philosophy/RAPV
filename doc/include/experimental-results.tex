In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques.
All the experiments are conducted on a \abbr{GNU}/Linux machine equipped with 16 processors Intel Xeon E5520 2.27~\abbr{GH}z and 24~\abbr{GB} of \abbr{RAM}.
Parallel computing is utilized only in the experiments reported in \sref{experimental-results-optimization}.
