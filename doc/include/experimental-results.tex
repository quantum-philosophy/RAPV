In this section, we elaborate on the performance of the proposed techniques.
All the experiments are conducted on a \abbr{GNU}/Linux machine equipped with 16 processors Intel Xeon E5520 2.27~\abbr{GH}z and 24~\abbr{GB} of \abbr{RAM}.

We consider a 45-nm technological process and rely on the 45-nm standard-cell library published and maintained by NanGate \cite{nangate}.
The effective channel length and gate-oxide thickness are assumed to have nominal values equal to 22.5~nm and 1~nm, respectively.
Following the information about process variation reported by \abbr{ITRS} \cite{itrs}, we assume that each process parameter can deviate up to 12\% of its nominal value, and this percentage is treated as three standard deviations.
The corresponding probabilistic model is the one described in \sref{parameter-preprocessing} where the correlation function is taken from \cite{ukhov2014}, and the model-order reduction procedure is set to preserve 95\% of the variance of the problem (see also \xref{model-order-reduction}).
The tuning parameter $\anisotropyKnob$ in \eref{dimension-anisotropy} is set to 0.25.

Heterogeneous platforms and periodic applications are generated randomly using \abbr{TGFF} \cite{dick1998} in such a way that the execution time of tasks is uniformly distributed between 10 and 30~ms, and their dynamic power between 6 and 20~W.
The floorplans of the platforms are regular grids wherein each processing element occupies $2 \times 2\,\text{mm}^2$.
The granularity of power and temperature profiles, that is, $\dt$ in \sref{temperature-solution} and \xref{temperature-solution}, is set to 1~ms.
The stopping condition in \aref{temperature-solution} is a decrease of the normalized root-mean-square error between two successive temperature profiles smaller than 1\%, which typically requires 3--5 iterations.
In addition to the reduction of the stochastic dimensionality $\nvars$, we reduce the state-space dimensionality $\nnodes$ of the thermal system in \eref{thermal-model}.
In this case, we discard the nodes with the smallest Hankel singular values and alter the remaining ones to preserve the \abbr{DC} gain of the system.
The reduction procedure is configured to preserve 95\% of the energy of the system while ensuring that the decrease of $\nnodes$ is at most 40\%.
These constraints have been found empirically, and the corresponding reduction does not have any significant impact on accuracy.

The leakage model needed for the calculation of $\mP_\static(\vu, \mQ)$ in \aref{temperature-solution} is based on \abbr{SPICE} simulations of a series of \abbr{CMOS} invertors taken from the NanGate cell library and configured according to the high-performance 45-nm \abbr{PTM} \cite{ptm}.
The simulations are performed on a fine-grained and sufficiently broad three-dimensional grid comprising the effective channel length, gate-oxide thickness, and temperature; the results are tabulated.
The interpolation facilities of \abbr{MATLAB} \cite{matlab} are then utilized whenever we need to evaluate the leakage power for a particular point within the range of the grid.
The output of the constructed leakage model is scaled up to account for about 40\% of the total power dissipation \cite{liu2007}.

For the purpose of the optimization described in \sref{reliability-optimization}, we utilize a genetic algorithm.
Each chromosome is a $2 \ntasks$-element vector concatenating a pair of $\mapping$ (mapping) and $\priority$ (ranking).
The evaluation of a chromosome's fitness will be discussed later on.
The population contains $4 \ntasks$ individuals which are initialized using uniform distributions.
The parents for the next generation are chosen by a tournament selection with the number of competitors equal to 20\% of $\ntasks$.
A one-point crossover is then applied to 80\% of the parents.
Each parent undergoes a uniform mutation wherein each gene is altered with probability 0.01.
The top five-percent individuals always survive.
The stopping condition is the absence of improvement within 10 successive generations.

Since the optimization procedure outlined above embraces all the techniques developed throughout the paper, \ie, in \sref{uncertainty-analysis}--\sref[]{reliability-analysis}, we shall perform the assessment of these techniques directly in the design-space-exploration context.
In other words, we consider neither \DSS\ \ta\ nor reliability analysis as separate uncertainty quantification problems and shall focus on \eref{quantity-of-interest} directly.
