I think this paper has value in presenting use of various probabilistic schemes
for modeling and optimization.

However in order to be considered as a ``regular" paper, it would have been
nice to get correlations between their reliability and thermal models with with
real detailed simulations (leakage enhanced hotspot, EM simulation studies
etc.).

Another deficiency in my view is that while the paper deals with
manufacturing variations, it does not mention anything about modeling errors
(thermal, power etc.). Generating more detailed validation data would be very
hard.

Hence I recommend the paper be accepted in a brief form (since the
mathematical contributions are interesting and relevant). In my view the paper
is deficient as a regular submission.
