I think this paper has value in presenting use of various probabilistic schemes
for modeling and optimization. However in order to be considered as a
``regular" paper, it would have been nice to get correlations between their
reliability and thermal models with with real detailed simulations (leakage
enhanced hotspot, EM simulation studies etc.). Another deficiency in my view is
that while the paper deals with manufacturing variations, it does not mention
anything about modeling errors (thermal, power etc.). Generating more detailed
validation data would be very hard. Hence I recommend the paper be accepted in
a brief form (since the mathematical contributions are interesting and
relevant). In my view the paper is deficient as a regular submission.
