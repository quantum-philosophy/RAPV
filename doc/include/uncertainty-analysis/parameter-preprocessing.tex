Our foremost task is to transform $\vu$ into mutually independent \rvs\ as independence is a prerequisite of the forthcoming mathematical treatment.
To this end, an adequate probability transformation should be undertaken depending on the available information; see \cite{eldred2008} for an overview.
One transformation for which the assumed knowledge about $\vu$ is sufficient is the Nataf transformation \cite{li2008}.
Denote this transformation by
\begin{equation} \elab{probability-transformation}
  \vu = \transformation{\vz},
\end{equation}
which relates $\nparams \nprocs$ dependent \rvs, \ie, $\vu$, with $\nvars$ independent \rvs
\begin{equation} \elab{independent-random-variables}
  \vz = (\z_i)_{i = 1}^\nvars.
\end{equation}
Regardless of the marginals, $\z_i \sim \gaussianDistribution{0, 1}$, $i = 1, \dots, \nvars$, that is, each $\z_i$ has the standard Gaussian distribution.
Refer to \xref{probability-transformation} for further details about the Nataf transformation.

As we shall discuss later on, the stochastic dimensionality $\nvars$ of the problem has a considerable impact of the computational complexity of our framework.
Therefore, an important part of the preprocessing stage is model order reduction.
To this end, without introducing additional transformations, we let $\transformation$ be augmented with such a reduction procedure.
Thus, $\nvars \leq \nparams \nprocs$.
This duty of $\transformation$ is further discussed in \xref{model-order-reduction}.

Let us turn to the illustrative application.
Recall that we exemplify our framework considering the effective channel length and gate-oxide thickness with the notation given in \eref{application-uncertain-parameters}.
Both parameters correspond to Euclidean distances; they take values on bounded intervals of the positive part of the real line.
With this in mind, we model the two process parameters using the four-parametric family of beta distributions:
\begin{equation*}
  \u_i \sim \distribution_{\u_i} = \betaDistribution{a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i}
\end{equation*}
where $i = 1, \dots, \nparams \nprocs$, $a_i$ and $b_i$ control the shape of the distributions, and $[ c_i, d_i ]$ correspond their supports.
