The function given by \eref{spectral-decomposition} is nothing more than a polynomial; hence, it is easy to interpret and easy to evaluate.
Thus, having constructed such an expansion, various statistics about $\w$ can be estimated at no effort.
Moreover, \eref{spectral-decomposition} yields analytical formulae for the expected value and variance of $\w$.
