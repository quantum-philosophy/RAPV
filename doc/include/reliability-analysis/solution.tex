Guided by the aforementioned observations, we propose to use the spectral decompositions developed in \sref{uncertainty-analysis} and \sref{temperature-analysis} in order to construct a light surrogate for $\pvw$.
The proposed technique is founded on the basis of the state-of-the-art reliability models by enriching their modeling capabilities with respect to process variation and by speeding up the associated computational process.
This approach allows one to seamlessly incorporate into reliability analysis the effect of process variation on process parameters.
In particular, the framework allows for a straightforward propagation of the uncertainty from process parameters through power and temperature to the lifetime of the system.
In contrast to the straightforward use of \abbr{MC} sampling, the spectral representation that we construct makes the subsequent analysis highly efficient from the computational perspective.

It is worth noting that $\survival_\T(\cdot | \pvw)$ is left intact, meaning that our approach does not impose any restrictions on $\survival_\T(\cdot | \pvw)$ and, thus, is readily applicable to any model that the user considers to be the most adequate for the problem at hand.
