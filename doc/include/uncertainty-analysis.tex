The key building block of our solutions developed in \sref{temperature-analysis} and \sref{reliability-analysis} is the uncertainty quantification technique presented below.
The main task of this technique is the propagation of uncertainty through the system, that is, from a set of inputs to a set of outputs.
Specifically, the inputs are the uncertain parameters $\vu$, and the outputs are the quantities that we are interested in studying.
The latter can be, for instance, the energy consumption, maximal temperature, or temperature profile of the system over a certain period of time.

Due to the inherent complexity, uncertainty quantification problems are typically viewed as approximation problems: one constructs a computationally efficient surrogate for the stochastic model under consideration first and then studies this light representation instead.
In order to construct such an approximation, we appeal to spectral methods \cite{maitre2010, janson1997, eldred2008}.
The approach taken in this work can be classified as non-intrusive since the system is treated as a ``black box.''

\subsection{Uncertainty Model}
Before we proceed to the construction, let us first refine our definition of $\vu = (\u_i)_{i = 1}^\nparams$.
Each $\u_i$ is a characteristic of a single transistor (consider, for example, the effective channel length), and, therefore, each device in the electrical circuits at hand can potentially have a different value of this parameter as, in general, the variability due to process variation is not uniform.
Consequently, each $\u_i$ can be viewed as a random process $\u_i: \outcomes \times \domain \to \real$ defined on an appropriate spatial domain $\domain \subset \real^3$.
Since this work is system-level oriented, we model each processing element with one variable for each such random process.
More specifically, we let $\u_{ij} = \u_i(\cdot, \vr_j)$ be the \rv\ representing the $i$th uncertain parameter at the $j$th processing element where $\vr_j$ stands for the spatial location of the processing element (\eg, the center of mass).
Thus, we redefine the parameterization of the problem as
\begin{equation} \elab{uncertain-parameters}
  \vu = (\u_i)_{i = 1}^{\nparams \nprocs}
\end{equation}
such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between $\u_i$, $i = 1, \dots, \nparams \nprocs$, and $\u_{ij}$, $i = 1, \dots, \nparams$, $j = 1, \dots, \nprocs$.
\begin{remark}
Some authors prefer to split the variability of a process parameter at a spatial location into several parts such as wafer-to-wafer, die-to-die, and within-die; see, \eg, \cite{juan2012}.
However, from the mathematical standpoint, it is sufficient to consider just one random variable per location which is adequately correlated with the other locations of interest.
\end{remark}

A description of $\vu$ is an input to our analysis given by the user.
A proper (complete, unambiguous) way to describe a set of \rvs\ is to specify their joint probability distribution function.
In practice, however, such exhaustive information is often unavailable, in particular, due to the high dimensionality in the presence of prominent dependencies inherent to the considered problem.
A more realistic assumption is the knowledge of the marginal distributions and correlation matrix of $\u$.
For concreteness, we shall orientate our framework towards the practical scenario; one should keep in mind, though, that, in general, the marginals and correlation matrix are not sufficient to recover the joint distribution.
Denote by $\{ \distribution_{\u_i} \}_{i = 1}^{\nparams \nprocs}$ and $\mCorr_\u \in \real^{\nparams \nprocs \times \nparams \nprocs}$ the marginal distribution functions and correlation matrix of $\vu$ in \eref{uncertain-parameters}, respectively.
Note that the number of distinct marginals is only $\nparams$ since $\nprocs$ components of $\vu$ correspond to the same uncertain parameter.
