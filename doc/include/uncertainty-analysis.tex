The key building block of our solutions developed in \sref{temperature-analysis}--\sref[]{reliability-optimization} is the uncertainty quantification technique presented in this section.
The main task of this technique is the propagation of uncertainty through the system, that is, from a set of inputs to a set of outputs.
Specifically, the inputs are the uncertain parameters $\vu$, and the outputs are the quantities that we are interested in studying.
The latter can be, for instance, the energy consumption, maximal temperature, or temperature profile of the system over a certain period of time.

Due to the inherent complexity, uncertainty quantification problems are typically viewed as approximation problems: one first constructs a computationally efficient surrogate for the stochastic model under consideration and then studies this computationally efficient representation instead of the original model.
In order to construct such an approximation, we appeal to spectral methods \cite{maitre2010, janson1997, eldred2008}.

\subsection{Uncertainty Model}
Before we proceed to the construction of light surrogate models, let us first refine our definition of $\vu = (\u_i)_{i = 1}^\nparams$.
Each $\u_i$ is a characteristic of a single transistor (consider, \eg, the effective channel length), and, therefore, each device in the electrical circuits at hand can potentially have a different value of this parameter as, in general, the variability due to process variation is not uniform.
Consequently, each $\u_i$ can be viewed as a random process $\u_i: \outcomes \times \domain \to \real$ defined on an appropriate spatial domain $\domain \subset \real^2$.
Since this work is system-level oriented, we model each processing element with one variable for each such random process.
More specifically, we let $\u_{ij} = \u_i(\cdot, \vr_j)$ be the \rv\ representing the $i$th uncertain parameter at the $j$th processing element where $\vr_j$ stands for the spatial location of the center of the processing element.
Therefore, we redefine the parameterization $\vu$ of the problem at hand as
\begin{equation} \elab{uncertain-parameters}
  \vu = (\u_i)_{i = 1}^{\nparams \nprocs}
\end{equation}
such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between $\u_i$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, \nparams \nprocs$, and $\u_{ij}$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, \nparams$, $j = 1, 2, \dots, \nprocs$.
For instance, in our illustrative application with two process parameters, the total number of stochastic dimensions is $2 \nprocs$.
\begin{remark}
Some authors prefer to split the variability of a process parameter at a spatial location into several parts such as wafer-to-wafer, die-to-die, and within-die; see, \eg, \cite{juan2012}.
However, from the mathematical point of view, it is sufficient to consider just one random variable per location which is adequately correlated with the other locations of interest.
\end{remark}

A description of $\vu$ is an input to our analysis given by the user, and we consider it to be a part of the system specification $\specification$.
A proper (complete, unambiguous) way to describe a set of \rvs\ is to specify their joint probability distribution function.
In practice, however, such exhaustive information is often unavailable, in particular, due to the high dimensionality in the presence of prominent dependencies inherent to the considered problem.
A more realistic assumption is the knowledge of the marginal distributions and correlation matrix of $\u$.
Denote by $\{ \distribution_{\u_i} \}_{i = 1}^{\nparams \nprocs}$ and $\mCorr_\u \in \real^{\nparams \nprocs \times \nparams \nprocs}$ the marginal distribution functions and correlation matrix of the uncertain parameters $\vu$ in \eref{uncertain-parameters}, respectively.
Note that the number of distinct marginals is only $\nparams$ since $\nprocs$ components of $\vu$ correspond to the same uncertain parameter.
