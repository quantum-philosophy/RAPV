\updated{In this section, we detail our \ta, which is suitable for system-level studies.}
We shall cover both the transient and \dss\ scenarios as the former is a prerequisite for the latter.
Since temperature is a direct consequence of power, we begin with the power model utilized in the proposed framework.
