In this section, we develop our \ta, which is the core of the reliability modeling presented in \sref{reliability-analysis}.
We shall cover both the transient and \dss\ scenarios as the former is a prerequisite for the latter.
Since temperature is a direct consequence of power, we begin with the power model utilized in the proposed framework.
