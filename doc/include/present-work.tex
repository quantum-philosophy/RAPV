Our work makes to the following major contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~1.} Based on the stochastic approach to \tta\ presented in \cite{ukhov2014}, we extend the deterministic \DSS\ \ta\ presented in \cite{ukhov2012} to account for the uncertainty due to process variation.
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~2.} We develop a framework for the reliability analysis of electronic systems that enriches the state-of-the-art reliability models by rigorously taking into consideration the aforementioned uncertainty.
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~3.} We show the virtue of our probabilistic approach to temperature modeling with respect to the characterization of various design quantities that are of high importance yet unknown at the design stage due to the presence of process variation.
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~4.} We construct a computationally efficient design-space exploration procedure targeted at the minimization of the energy consumption, which is \apriori\ random, under probabilistic constraints on the thermal behavior and lifetime of the system.
\end{itemize}
