Our work makes to the following major contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~1.} We extend \dssta\ presented in \cite{ukhov2012} by accounting for the uncertainty due to process variation.
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~2.} We develop a framework for the reliability analysis of electronic systems that enriches the state-of-the-art reliability models by rigorously taking into consideration the aforementioned uncertainty.
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~3.} We show the virtue of our probabilistic approach to temperature modeling, both transient and dynamic steady-state, for the characterization of various quantities that are of high importance yet unknown at the design stage due to the presence of process variation.
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~4.} We construct a computationally efficient design-space exploration procedure targeted at the minimization of the energy consumption, which is \apriori\ random, under probabilistic constraints on the thermal behavior and lifetime of the system.
\end{itemize}
