Our work has to the following major contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~1.} Based on the stochastic approach to \tta\ presented in \cite{ukhov2014}, we extend the deterministic \DSS\ \ta\ presented in \cite{ukhov2012} to account for the uncertainty due to process variation.
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~2.} We develop a framework for the reliability analysis of electronic systems that enriches the state-of-the-art reliability models by taking into consideration the effect of process variation on temperature.
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~3.} We construct a computationally efficient design-space exploration procedure targeted at the minimization of the energy consumption, which is \apriori\ random, under probabilistic constraints on the thermal behavior and lifetime of the system.
\end{itemize}
