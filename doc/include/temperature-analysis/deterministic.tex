A robust and computationally efficient solution of \eref{temperature-model} for a given $\o \in \outcomes$, or equivalently for a given $\u(\o)$, is an essential part of our probabilistic framework.
In order to attain such a solution, we utilize a numerical method from the family of so-called exponential integrators \cite{hochbruck2010}.
The procedure is described in \xref{temperature-model}, and here we only use the final result; see also \cite{ukhov2012}.

Recall that we are to analyze a dynamic power profile $\mP_\dynamic$ covering a time interval $[0, \period]$ with $\nsteps$ samples that are evenly spaced in time.
The transient solution of \eref{temperature-model-inner} is reduced to the following recurrence for $k = 1, \dots, \nsteps$:
\begin{equation} \elabel{recurrence}
  \vX_k = \mE \: \vX_{k - 1} + \mF \: \vP_k
\end{equation}
where the subscript $k$ stands for time $k \dt$, $\vX_0 = \vZero$,
\[
  \mE = e^{\mA \dt}, \hspace{1em} \text{and} \hspace{1em} \mF = \mA^{-1} (e^{\mA \dt} - \mI) \: \mB.
\]
For computational efficiency, the state matrix $\mA$ is factorized using the eigenvalue decomposition as follows \cite{press2007}:
\begin{equation} \elabel{eigenvalue-decomposition}
  \mA = \mV \mL \mV^T
\end{equation}
where $\mV$ and $\mL = \diag{\lambda_i}$ are an orthogonal matrix of the eigenvectors and a diagonal matrix of the eigenvectors of $\mA$, respectively.
The matrices $\mE$ and $\mF$ are then
\begin{align*}
  & \mE = \mV \; \diag{e^{\lambda_i \dt}} \mV^T \text{ and} \\
  & \mF = \mV \; \diag{ \frac{e^{\lambda_i \dt} - 1}{\lambda_i} } \mV^T \mB.
\end{align*}
To sum up, the derivation up to this point is sufficient to for the \tta\ via \eref{recurrence} followed by \eref{temperature-model-outer}.
\begin{remark}
Although we always refer to temperature, each temperature analysis developed in this paper is essentially accompanied by the corresponding power analysis as the two are inseparable due to the leakage-temperature interplay.
Consequently, when it is appropriate, one can easily extract only the (temperature-aware) power part of the presented solutions.
\end{remark}

Let us move on to the \dss\ case.
In this subsection, we address the case when $\o$ is fixed in \eref{power-model} (and, hence, in \eref{temperature-model}).
In other words, the parametrization $\vU(\o)$ is known, which we emphasize by $\vU$.
Assume for now that $\vP_\static$ in \eref{power-model} does not depend on $\vQ$, \ie, there is no interdependency between leakage and temperature.
Under the dynamic steady-state condition, $\vX_1 = \vX_{\nsteps + 1}$.
This boundary constraint and the recurrence in \eref{recurrence} yield a large system of $\nnodes \nsteps$ linear equations with $\nnodes \nsteps$ unknowns.
As shown in \cite{ukhov2012}, this problem can be efficiently solved by exploiting the particular structure of the system and the decomposition in \eref{eigenvalue-decomposition}.
The pseudocode of this algorithm is given in \aref{deterministic-solution}.\footnote{Hereafter, we utilize the MATLAB notation to refer to a particular column, \eg, $\m{A}(:, k)$, or a particular row, \eg, $\m{A}(k, :)$, of a matrix $\m{A}$. Also, we shall underline auxiliary vectors, \eg, $\tmp{\v{a}}$, and matrices, \eg, $\tmp{\m{A}}$.}
\input{include/algorithms/deterministic-solution.tex}

The time complexity of direct solutions of the system is $\bigO(\nsteps^3 \nnodes^3)$ while the one of \aref{deterministic-solution} is only $\bigO(\nsteps \nnodes^2 + \nnodes^3)$.\footnote{The complexity reported in \cite{ukhov2012} is erroneously overestimated to $\bigO(\nsteps \nnodes^3)$.}

In order to account for the leakage-temperature interdependence, \aref{deterministic-solution} is to be repeated for a sequence of total power profiles until the corresponding sequence of temperature profiles converges or some other stopping condition is met (\eg, a maximal temperature constraint is violated).
Each power profile is computed according to \eref{power-model} with respect to the temperature profile from the previous iteration starting from the ambient temperature.
This procedure is illustrated in \aref{deterministic-solution-with-leakage}.
\input{include/algorithms/deterministic-solution-with-leakage.tex}

In \aref{deterministic-solution-with-leakage}, $\mP_\static(\mQ, \vU)$ should be understood as a call to a subroutine that returns an $\nprocs \times \nsteps$ matrix wherein the $(i, j)$th element is the static component of the power dissipation of the $i$th processing element at the $j$th moment of time with respect to the temperature given by the $(i, j)$th element of $\mQ$ and $\vU$.
