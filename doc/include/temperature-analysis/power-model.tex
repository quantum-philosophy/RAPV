The total power dissipation $\vP \in \real^\nprocs$ of the $\nprocs$ processing elements is modeled as the following composition:
\begin{equation} \elabel{power-model}
  \vP(\t, \o) = \vP_\dynamic(\t) + \vP_\static(\vQ(\t, \o), \vU(\o))
\end{equation}
where $\vP_\dynamic \in \real^\nprocs$ and $\vP_\static \in \real^\nprocs$ are the dynamic and static components, respectively, and $\vQ \in \real^\nprocs$ is the temperature of the processing elements.
$\vP_\dynamic$ does not depend on $\vU(\o)$ as the influence of process variation on the dynamic power is known to be negligibly small \cite{srivastava2010}.
On the other hand, the variability of $\vP_\static$ is substantial and is further magnified by the well-known interdependency between leakage and temperature.
