We have presented a number of techniques for uncertainty quantification of electronic systems subjected to process variation.
First, we developed a process-variation-aware approach to \dssta.
Second, we proposed a framework for reliability analysis that seamlessly takes into account the variability of process parameters and, in particular, the effect of process variation on temperature.
We drew a comparison with \abbr{MC} sampling, which confirmed the efficiency of our solutions in terms of both accuracy and speed.
The low computational demand of our techniques implies that they are readily applicable for practical instantiations inside design-space exploration loops, which is also demonstrated in this work considering an energy-driven stochastic optimization procedure under reliability-driven constraints.
