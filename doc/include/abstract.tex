Electronic system design based on deterministic techniques for temperature analysis is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty is disregarded.
In this work, we propose a flexible probabilistic framework targeted at the quantification of temperature fluctuations under the dynamic steady-state condition deteriorated by process variation.
Given an electronic system under a periodic workload, our technique delivers an analytical representation of the corresponding stochastic temperature, which allows for a computationally efficient evaluation of arbitrary probabilistic quantities of arbitrary temperature-related characteristics of the system under consideration.
Furthermore, using our framework, we develop a process-variation-aware reliability model addressing the failures due to the thermal-cycling fatigue.
The approximation accuracy and computational speed of the proposed approach are assessed via Monte Carlo simulations.
