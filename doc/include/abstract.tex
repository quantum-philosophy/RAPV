Electronic system design based on deterministic techniques for power and temperature analysis is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty is disregarded.
In this work, we propose a flexible probabilistic framework targeted at the analysis of temperature-induced failures amplified by the uncertainty due to process variation.
Given an electronic system under a certain workload, our technique delivers the corresponding survival function, founded on the basis of the well-established reliability models, with a closed-form stochastic parametrization in terms of the quantities that are uncertain at the design stage.
The proposed framework is exemplified considering systems with periodic workloads that suffer from the thermal-cycling fatigue.
The analysis of this fatigue requires the availability of detailed temperature profiles, which are uncertain due to the variability of such process parameters as the effective channel length and gate-oxide thickness, which we consider for our illustration.
Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the computational efficiency of our solution, we undertake a design-space exploration procedure seeking for the minimal energy consumption, which is also a random quantity, under a set of timing, thermal, and reliability constraints.
