Throughout the manuscript, we shall denote scalar, vector, and matrix quantities by regular lower-case, bold lower-case, and bold upper-case letters, respectively.

Let $(\outcomes, \sigmaAlgebra, \probabilityMeasure)$ be a complete probability space where $\outcomes$ is a set of outcomes, $\sigmaAlgebra \subseteq 2^\outcomes$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\outcomes$, and $\probabilityMeasure: \sigmaAlgebra \to [0, 1]$ is a probability measure \cite{maitre2010}.
A random variable $x(\o)$ is a function $x: \outcomes \to \real$ (the real line) which is measurable with respect to $\sigmaAlgebra$.
A random vector $\v{x}(\o) = (x_i(\o))$ and a random matrix $\m{X}(\o) = (x_{ij}(\o))$ are then a vector and a matrix whose elements are \rvs.
Finally, we denote by $\L{2}(\outcomes) := \L{2}(\outcomes, \sigmaAlgebra, \probabilityMeasure)$ the space of all square-integrable \rvs\ defined on $(\outcomes, \sigmaAlgebra, \probabilityMeasure)$.
